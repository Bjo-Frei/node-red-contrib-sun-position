            <dt class="optional">south <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
            <dd> is only includet if  `azimuthSouthLow` or `azimuthSouthHigh` is defined and
                 is true if the azimuth of the calculated sun-position is higher than `azimuthSouthLow` and lower than `azimuthSouthHigh`.</dd>

            <dd> is only includet if  `azimuthEastLow` or `azimuthEastHigh` is defined and

            <dt class="optional">north <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
            <dd> is only includet if  `azimuthNorthLow` or `azimuthNorthHigh` is defined and
                 is true if the azimuth of the calculated sun-position is higher than `azimuthNorthLow` and lower than `azimuthNorthHigh`.</dd>

            <dt class="optional">exposureChanged <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
            <dd> is only includet and `true` if  any of the `west`, `south`,`east` or `north` properties is includet and if any of these values has changed compared to the last calculation.</dd>
        </dl>
     <h3>Tips</h3>
     <p>For home automation it can be useful to define the lower and higher position by setting `azimuthWestLow` and `azimuthWestHigh` for example of the sun for the west side of a house. If this is done, the output of the `west` property, for example, can be used to control the blinds. Same for south, east and north.</p>
